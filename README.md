## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jinosh05/flutter_builders_example.git
cd flutter_builders_example
flutter pub get
```

Then, run the project:

```bash
flutter run
```

## Widgets and Scenarios

### Builder

The `Builder` widget is a general-purpose widget that builds a widget tree inside the builder function. This is particularly useful when you need a new context with different inherited widgets.

**Usage:**
```dart
Builder(
  builder: (BuildContext context) {
    return Text('Hello, Builder!');
  },
)
```

### ValueListenableBuilder

The `ValueListenableBuilder` is a widget that listens to a `ValueListenable` and rebuilds when the value changes.

**Usage:**
```dart
ValueListenableBuilder<int>(
  valueListenable: _counter,
  builder: (context, value, child) {
    return Text('Value: $value');
  },
)
```

### ValueListenableBuilder with Bloc

Combining `ValueListenableBuilder` with Bloc allows you to listen to state changes and rebuild the UI accordingly.

**Usage:**
```dart
ValueListenableBuilder<MyState>(
  valueListenable: myBloc.stream,
  builder: (context, state, child) {
    if (state is MyLoadedState) {
      return Text('Loaded: ${state.data}');
    }
    return CircularProgressIndicator();
  },
)
```

### ValueListenableBuilder with Cubit

Combining `ValueListenableBuilder` with Cubit allows you to listen to state changes and rebuild the UI accordingly.

**Usage:**
```dart
ValueListenableBuilder<MyState>(
  valueListenable: myCubit.stream,
  builder: (context, state, child) {
    if (state is MyLoadedState) {
      return Text('Loaded: ${state.data}');
    }
    return CircularProgressIndicator();
  },
)
```

### ValueListenableBuilder with Services

Using `ValueListenableBuilder` with services is useful for listening to service-based state changes.

**Usage:**
```dart
ValueListenableBuilder<ServiceState>(
  valueListenable: myService.stateNotifier,
  builder: (context, state, child) {
    if (state is ServiceLoadedState) {
      return Text('Service Data: ${state.data}');
    }
    return CircularProgressIndicator();
  },
)
```

### BlocBuilder's Universal Memory

`BlocBuilder` with universal memory refers to using a single Bloc for managing the state across multiple widgets or screens.

**Usage:**
```dart
BlocBuilder<MyBloc, MyState>(
  builder: (context, state) {
    if (state is MyLoadedState) {
      return Text('Data: ${state.data}');
    }
    return CircularProgressIndicator();
  },
)
```

### BlocBuilder's Page Memory

`BlocBuilder` with page memory is used to retain the state of a particular page or widget, even when navigating away and back to it.

**Usage:**
```dart
BlocProvider(
  create: (context) => MyBloc(),
  child: MyPage(),
)

// Inside MyPage
BlocBuilder<MyBloc, MyState>(
  builder: (context, state) {
    if (state is MyLoadedState) {
      return Text('Data: ${state.data}');
    }
    return CircularProgressIndicator();
  },
)
```

### BlocBuilder with Async Function

Using `BlocBuilder` with an async function allows handling asynchronous events and state changes.

**Usage:**
```dart
BlocBuilder<MyBloc, MyState>(
  builder: (context, state) {
    if (state is MyLoadingState) {
      return CircularProgressIndicator();
    } else if (state is MyLoadedState) {
      return Text('Data: ${state.data}');
    }
    return Text('Error');
  },
)
```

### CubitBuilder under Build When condition

`CubitBuilder` with a `buildWhen` condition allows you to conditionally rebuild your widget based on specific state changes.

**Usage:**
```dart
CubitBuilder<MyCubit, MyState>(
  buildWhen: (previous, current) {
    return current is MySpecificState; // Only rebuild if the state is MySpecificState
  },
  builder: (context, state) {
    if (state is MySpecificState) {
      return Text('Specific State Data: ${state.data}');
    }
    return CircularProgressIndicator();
  },
)
```

### BlocBuilder under Build When condition

`BlocBuilder` with a `buildWhen` condition allows you to conditionally rebuild your widget based on specific state changes.

**Usage:**
```dart
BlocBuilder<MyBloc, MyState>(
  buildWhen: (previous, current) {
    return current is MySpecificState; // Only rebuild if the state is MySpecificState
  },
  builder: (context, state) {
    if (state is MySpecificState) {
      return Text('Specific State Data: ${state.data}');
    }
    return CircularProgressIndicator();
  },
)
```

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates various advanced state management techniques in Flutter using different combinations of `Builder`, `ValueListenableBuilder`, `BlocBuilder`, and `Cubit`. Feel free to explore the code and adapt these patterns to your own Flutter projects!
